=============
- IMPORTANT: FlowEditorCommands shall only be able to apply changes if its state is current!
- IMPORTANT: Implement FlowEditorCommands.refresh();

- UploadManager in flow editor commands, not in a scope context
- Paste plain text (convert to flow content - line breaks, paragraph breaks, lists?)

  - Feedback during long running operation
  - Progress bar
- Insert emoji by typing (using WIN+PERIOD) is broken
- Deleting all when there's a final para break, shall result in an empty document with a para break
- Inserting a dynamic text ("apa") at end of preamble in "Rich" story and then double clicking it to select it doesnt cause toolbox to appear. (selection is out-of-sync?)
- Cannot place caret after last "Void Script" in "Dynamic Text States" (trailing para)
- Client/server/proto

- Copy flow content to clipboard
- Pase flow content when available

- Tool: Set line height
- Tool: Set font size
- Tool: Set font family
- HOME/END keys doesn't work as expected
- Fix caret design when placed inside template.

LOWER PRIO
==========
- Paste HTML
- When changing icon, select the current icon pack + tag and scroll it into view.
- Select/Edit custom flow icon
- Italic caret does not work. It needs to be inline with outline so that it doesn't mess with line breaking. But tranform requires inline-block...
- New interaction?: Open Topic
- ALT+ENTER shall open insert menu with keyboard focus
- New Ops: Wrap + Unwrap
- FlowTable
- FlowVideo
- FlowAudio
- Escape to close menu, but not toolbox
- Double press CTRL + period shall select entire innermost flow box (press again to select next outer box)
- Hide toolbox arrow when selection includes para break
- Hide toolbox while typing?
- MultiFlowSelection
- Paratype: use actual name instead of "freezing"
- React jest snapshots for view comps
- Review react exports
- Unify interaction code in FlowButtonView and LinkView
- @validating should verify new.target in ctor
- XML name + attrs on flow box
- CTRL+PERIOD shall open contextual toolbar with keyboard navigation
- ScriptEditor + OpenUrlEditor must notify on size change and trigger popper update (useContext for this. must apply to both tool menu and tool tip)
- ScriptEditor: Improve error handling (do not report unexpected tokens that doesn't exist. handle empty expression better?)
- Maybe an icon in ScriptEditor/OpenUrlEditor to distinguish between what the input will do?
- MUI lib
- Small caps in text style
- Custom spellchecker
- FlowEditor classes prop
- FlowTheme vs EditorTheme
- FlowTypography (default is SYSTEM_FONT)
- Named para/text styles
