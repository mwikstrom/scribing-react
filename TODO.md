SCRIBING TODO
=============

- Tool: Insert button
- Tool button spacing is inconsistent
- Caret is lost when moving right at end of content
- Cannot insert text before/after block level button
- Special para theme for "inside button"? Or at least fix margin or first/last/single para
- Formatting paragraph break with zero opacity is not generally a good idea
- Let tooltip manager activate the tip that is currently scrolled into view
- CTRL+PERIOD shall open contextual toolbar with keyboard navigation
