SCRIBING TODO
=============
- Generic selector: Paragraph Variant Selector, Icon Pack Selector, Box Variant Selector
- MDI tag selector
- Icon chooser
- FlowIcon: Cannot use as link because click is intercepted for selection!
- FlowIcon
  - Insert icon
  - Change icon?
  - Edit custom icon path
- UrlResolver (callback event): Use for OpenUrl + Media interaction. Results in broken/resolved (with title and/or external-flag)
- Cannot step out of multi-output template box
- FlowImage
  - Insert image from file

  - Use intersection observer to load images
  - Extract and assign placeholder when replacing/inserting image
  - Replace image from file
  - Drag & Drop to replace image
  - Image story
- Insert emoji by typing (using WIN+PERIOD) is broken
- Deleting all when there's a final para break, shall result in an empty document with a para break
- Inserting a dynamic text ("apa") at end of preamble in "Rich" story and then double clicking it to select it does cause toolbox to appear. (selection is out-of-sync?)
- Cannot place caret after last "Void Script" in "Dynamic Text States" (trailing para)
- Client/server/proto
- Unify inline components: DynamicTextView, FlowIconView, LineBreakView?
- Copy flow content to clipboard
- Pase flow content when available
- Fix pilcrow after full width flow box
- Fix insert content after full width flow box
- Cannot move down using arrow key when caret is placed before/inside inline box surrounded by text

- Tool: Set list counter
- Tool: Set line height
- Tool: Set font size
- Tool: Set font family
- HOME/END keys doesn't work as expected

LOWER PRIO
==========
- Italic caret does not work. It needs to be inline with outline so that it doesn't mess with line breaking. But tranform requires inline-block...
- New interaction?: Open Topic
- ALT+ENTER shall open insert menu with keyboard focus
- New Ops: Wrap + Unwrap
- FlowTable
- FlowVideo
- FlowAudio
- Escape to close menu, but not toolbox
- Double press CTRL + period shall select entire innermost flow box (press again to select next outer box)
- Hide toolbox arrow when selection includes para break
- Hide toolbox while typing?
- MultiFlowSelection
- Paratype: use actual name instead of "freezing"
- React jest snapshots for view comps
- Review react exports
- Unify interaction code in FlowButtonView and LinkView
- @validating should verify new.target in ctor
- XML name + attrs on flow box
- CTRL+PERIOD shall open contextual toolbar with keyboard navigation
- ScriptEditor + OpenUrlEditor must notify on size change and trigger popper update (useContext for this. must apply to both tool menu and tool tip)
- ScriptEditor: Improve error handling (do not report unexpected tokens that doesn't exist. handle empty expression better?)
- Maybe an icon in ScriptEditor/OpenUrlEditor to distinguish between what the input will do?
- MUI lib
- Small caps in text style
- Custom spellchecker
- FlowEditor classes prop
- FlowTheme vs EditorTheme
- FlowTypography (default is SYSTEM_FONT)
- Named para/text styles
