SCRIBING TODO
=============
- Declare asset loader scope in flow view
- Drag & Drop to add image
- Drag & Drop to replace image
- Flow image is flickering (with empty background) when changing pargraph list level
- Copy flow content
- Paste flow content
- Copy image
- UrlResolver (callback event): Use for OpenUrl + Media interaction. Results in broken/resolved (with title and/or external-flag)
- Paste plain text (convert to flow content - line breaks, paragraph breaks, lists?)
- Cannot step out of multi-output template box
- Double click to select word is broken
- Virtual element for image is not covering entire image. Toolbox is malplaced.
- Lynk & Co needs:
  - Expand/collapse (summary/details)
  - Task stepper (maybe a kind of list marker? + ability to set whether it is "active"?)
  - Feedback during long running operation
  - Progress bar
- Insert emoji by typing (using WIN+PERIOD) is broken
- Deleting all when there's a final para break, shall result in an empty document with a para break
- Inserting a dynamic text ("apa") at end of preamble in "Rich" story and then double clicking it to select it doesnt cause toolbox to appear. (selection is out-of-sync?)
- Cannot place caret after last "Void Script" in "Dynamic Text States" (trailing para)
- Client/server/proto
- Unify inline components: DynamicTextView, FlowIconView, LineBreakView?
- Copy flow content to clipboard
- Pase flow content when available
- Fix pilcrow after full width flow box

- Cannot move down using arrow key when caret is placed before/inside inline box surrounded by text
- Double arrow is needed to move out of empty flow box
- Tool: Set list counter
- Tool: Set line height
- Tool: Set font size
- Tool: Set font family
- HOME/END keys doesn't work as expected
- Fix caret design when placed inside template.
- Fix actual caret selection when placed inside template. Click in template should allow edit.
- Custom component node. Script shall be used to apply component props. It shall be wrapped in an error boundary. MAYBE EVENT JSX in SCRIPTHOST?!
- Cannot select all and toggle spell check style when selection includes code (ambient spell check = false)
- Caret color is not correct when placed adjacent to flow image
- Provide feedback while creating flow image placeholder and in case that operation fail

LOWER PRIO
==========
- Paste HTML
- When changing icon, select the current icon pack + tag and scroll it into view.
- Select/Edit custom flow icon
- Italic caret does not work. It needs to be inline with outline so that it doesn't mess with line breaking. But tranform requires inline-block...
- New interaction?: Open Topic
- ALT+ENTER shall open insert menu with keyboard focus
- New Ops: Wrap + Unwrap
- FlowTable
- FlowVideo
- FlowAudio
- Escape to close menu, but not toolbox
- Double press CTRL + period shall select entire innermost flow box (press again to select next outer box)
- Hide toolbox arrow when selection includes para break
- Hide toolbox while typing?
- MultiFlowSelection
- Paratype: use actual name instead of "freezing"
- React jest snapshots for view comps
- Review react exports
- Unify interaction code in FlowButtonView and LinkView
- @validating should verify new.target in ctor
- XML name + attrs on flow box
- CTRL+PERIOD shall open contextual toolbar with keyboard navigation
- ScriptEditor + OpenUrlEditor must notify on size change and trigger popper update (useContext for this. must apply to both tool menu and tool tip)
- ScriptEditor: Improve error handling (do not report unexpected tokens that doesn't exist. handle empty expression better?)
- Maybe an icon in ScriptEditor/OpenUrlEditor to distinguish between what the input will do?
- MUI lib
- Small caps in text style
- Custom spellchecker
- FlowEditor classes prop
- FlowTheme vs EditorTheme
- FlowTypography (default is SYSTEM_FONT)
- Named para/text styles
- Show asset upload progress/error
