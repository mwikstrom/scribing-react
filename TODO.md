SCRIBING TODO
=============
- escape to toggle tooltips
- dynamic text: states: not ready + error
- dynamic button: states: invoking + error
- dynamic button: prevent default mouse down when ctrl clicking
- contextual toolbar: styling, edit script, etc.
- @validating should verify new.target in ctor
- Handle input compositions
- Scroll caret into view after inserting
- Make sure target options are given to formatText (FlowSelection)
- Cannot insert text before/after block level button
- Expanded nested selection is not synced. Perhaps we should display fully selected in another way?
- Special para theme for "inside button"
- Formatting paragraph break with zero opacity is not generally a good idea
- MultiFlowSelection
- Paratype: use actual name instead of "freezing"
- Merge basic ops in undo/redo stack before slicing them out...
- React jest snapshots for view comps
- Review react exports
- MUI lib
