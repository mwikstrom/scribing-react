SCRIBING TODO
=============
- Handle input compositions
- Scroll caret into view after inserting
- Expanded nested selection is not synced. Perhaps we should display fully selected in another way?
- Cannot insert text before/after block level button
- Special para theme for "inside button"
- Formatting paragraph break with zero opacity is not generally a good idea
- MultiFlowSelection
- Paratype: use actual name instead of "freezing"
- React jest snapshots for view comps
- Review react exports
- Use FlowEditorCommands in input handlers and key handlers
- Unify interaction code in FlowButtonView and LinkView
- @validating should verify new.target in ctor
- MUI lib
