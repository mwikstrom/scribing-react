    // nested editable flows. It just doesn't work occasionally.
    // Therefore we use the following customization.
    //
    // The idea is to first find the client position (x,y) of the current
    // focus point (which may or may not be a caret) and then move up/down
    // in increments of X pixels until we finds a new caret position (not the
    // one we started at) in a text node.
    //
    // I've chosen X = 10. Moving in increments of 10 pixels seems reasonable, but
    // we might want to adjust that. Optimally we would choose X to be exactly the
    // distance to the next/previous line box (but that distance is not obvious).
    //
    // In addition, we want to avoid ending up just after a paragraph break (similar
    // to how mousedown is handled in the FlowEditor).
    //
    // Finally we need to support the case when user holds down the shift key to just
    // move the focus point (not the caret).
